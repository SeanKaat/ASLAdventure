# ASLAdventure
This application was made for CS4605 at Georgia Tech (with Prof. Thad Starner). It is a prototype application for an ASL game that follows closely the format of a text adventure, except that a user signs to proceed to the next scenarios.

## Installation
`npm install -g expo-cli`

then 

`cd ASLAdventure`

`npm start` // you can also use: `expo start`
