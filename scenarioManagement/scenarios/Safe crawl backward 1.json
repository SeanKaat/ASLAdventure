    "content": "Crawling painfully backwards, you push yourself back out into the open. Well, into the less cramped, at any rate. You laugh nervously and take a deep breath.\n \n<b>Bottom of Pit</b>\nThis is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable, of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in the far corner.\n \nBats flutter everywhere, just overhead.\n \nA twisted corpse lies nearby.",
