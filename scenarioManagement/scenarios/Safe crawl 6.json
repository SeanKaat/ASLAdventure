Grow no deeper. You shake that away, and nothing comes to replace it.\n \nYou crawl on in the dark. The water grows no deeper.\n \nMaybe it's not as deep now?\n \n<b>Tight Crawl</b>\nWater trickles over your hands, but the floor must have risen; there is less of it... a note of hope. But you cannot see.",
