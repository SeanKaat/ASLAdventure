    "content": "You begin determinedly working yourself forward, again.\n \nTight Crawl\nThe rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length now, your arms stretched out ahead, but still rough stone scrapes your shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.\n \nIcy water is trickling past you.\n \nYou shake your head to disperse the cold mist, and start to rub your eyes. It doesn't help, except to smear blood all over your face.\n \nYour lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its workings.",
