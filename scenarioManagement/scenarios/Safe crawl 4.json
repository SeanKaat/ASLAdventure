Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?\n \n<b>Tight Crawl</b>\nYou lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your right knee.\n \nYou stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before you continue.\n \n<i>Splash.</i>\n \nYour fingers are submerged in water.",
