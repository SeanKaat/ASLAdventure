    "content": "In a rush, together and by no visible signal, the bats are airborne. The chittering cloud rises -- and then falls towards you.\n \nYou scramble back, covering your eyes; too late. The swarm is on you, harrying you, small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass. You cannot see. You stumble away from the storm, and the stone falls away into rushing water beneath you.\n \nNo doubt the bats find your body eventually.\n \n \n   *** You have died ***\n\t\nRESTART?",
