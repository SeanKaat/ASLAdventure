It's bleeding freely.\n \nThis is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable, of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in the far corner.\n \nA twisted shape lies nearby.",
