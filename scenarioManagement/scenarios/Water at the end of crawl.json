    "content": "You stretch your hands forward, submerging them. Hunch, stretch. Inchworm... inchworm...\n \nYour arms are submerged, and water ripples at your chin. No room to lift your head. You turn your face to the side, cheek scraping against the damn everpresent stone, and stretch again.\n \nYour lamp flickers once and goes out.\n \n<b>Tight Crawl</b>\nYou are lying in cold still water. It licks at your cheek and arms, and across the backs of your thighs. The chill makes your bruised knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No room.\n \nYou slump down. <i>Just a little rest</i>, a voice lies, but unfortunately you're too tired to argue with it.",
