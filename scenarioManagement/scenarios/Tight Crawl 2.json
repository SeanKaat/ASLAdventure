Crawling is hard work, you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere. You have just enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see ahead but more stone to crawl through.\n \nYou are starting to feel quite chill and distant.",
