You turn your face to the side, cheek scraping against the damn everpresent stone, and stretch again.\n \nYour lamp flickers once and goes out.\n \nTight Crawl\nYou are lying in cold still water. It licks at your cheek and arms, and across the backs of your thighs. The chill makes your bruised knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No room.",
