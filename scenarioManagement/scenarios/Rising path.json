And another, sliding past the beast, trying to be a thin part of the canyon wall...\n \nThe Wumpus, lashing out at bats, doesn't seem to notice.\n \nRising Path\nYou are partway up the canyon wall, on a narrow path that climbs from ledge to ledge. The cavern is vast around you, water-hewn strata stretching upward to the stone forest of the roof; and somewhere above you, a crack of daylight sets it all glimmering...\n \nDown on the canyon floor, the Wumpus thrashes within a rustling black cloud. Dark growls rise to you.",
