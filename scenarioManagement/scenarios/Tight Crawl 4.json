    "content": "You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. You're definitely tilted head-down now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?\n \nTight Crawl\nYou lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your right knee.\n \nYou stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before you continue.\n \nSplash.\n \nYour fingers are submerged in water.\n \nThe world is becoming distant. Shock, a voice says somewhere. That makes sense, you think; you can't have lost enough blood yet to affect you directly.",
