    "content": "The rough passage opens abruptly into vast space.\n \nBase of Canyon\nYou are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon. The walls spread upward around you. And the distant roof is hung with glimmering stars -- droplet-tipped stalactites in some hidden suffusion of light. You think, against your will, that it was worth it.\n \nA crevice runs along the canyon at your feet. You can cross it and continue on ahead, or re-enter the crawl behind you.\n \nThe Wumpus certainly fled this way: a pool of thick, dark, reeking blood is spilled across the ground. Bats crawl all around it -- rustling, fluttering, feasting.",
